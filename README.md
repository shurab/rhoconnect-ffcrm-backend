RhoConnect integration server with Fat Free CRM backend
-------------------------------------------------------------
Real-world backend application example based on Fat Free CRM, RhoConnect app, RhoConnect-rb plugin, and Rhodes client application.
This project demonstrates how RhoConnect integration server might be used to work with an open source, Ruby on Rails customer relationship management platform (Fat Free CRM) and includes the following components:

* Fat Free CRM: <https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm>
* RhoConnect Server: <http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhoconnect/introduction>
* RhoConnect Rails Plugin: <http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhoconnect/rails-plugin>
* Rhodes Client application: <http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/introduction>

Fat Free CRM
-------------------------------------------------------------
Directory `fat_free-crm` includes source of Fat Free CRM with the following changes:

* file `config\initializers\rhoconnect.rb` shows how to configure rhoconnect rails plugin 
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/account.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code (plugin resources, methods `partition` and `rhoconnect_query`)
* file ` fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/campaign.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/lead.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/opportunity.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/polymorphic/task.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/users/user.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code

All Fat Free CRM models have partitioned at application level (:app) and shared by all rhodes users. Only exception is `task` model. By business logic tasks always user specific and it  has :user partition.
