RhoConnect integration server with Fat Free CRM backend
-------------------------------------------------------------
Real-world backend application example based on Fat Free CRM, RhoConnect app, RhoConnect-rb plugin, and Rhodes client application.
This project demonstrates how RhoConnect integration server might be used to work with an open source, Ruby on Rails customer relationship management platform (Fat Free CRM) and includes the following components:

* Fat Free CRM: <https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm>
* RhoConnect Server: <http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhoconnect/introduction>
* RhoConnect Rails Plugin: <http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhoconnect/rails-plugin>
* Rhodes Client application: <http://docs.rhomobile.com/rhodes/introduction>

Fat Free CRM
-------------------------------------------------------------
Directory `fat_free-crm` includes source of Fat Free CRM with the following changes:

* file `config\initializers\rhoconnect.rb` shows how to configure rhoconnect rails plugin 
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/account.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code (plugin resources, methods `partition` and `rhoconnect_query`)
* file ` fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/campaign.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/lead.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/entities/opportunity.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/polymorphic/task.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code
* file `fat_free_crm/app/models/users/user.rb` includes required rhoconnect plugin code

All Fat Free CRM models have partitioned at application level (:app) and shared by all rhodes users. Only exception is `task` model. By business logic tasks always user specific and it  has :user partition.


RhoConnect Server
-------------------------------------------------------------

RhoConnect has one source adapter for `Account` model and shows how plugin REST API should be used in update/create/delete mothods.
Method `query` demonstates usage of RhoConeect API method `stash_result`. This method might be very usuful in the case of 
large datasets on backend.

Rhodes Client application
-------------------------------------------------------------
Application is generated by running `rhodes` generator and has the following models:   

* Account
* Campaign
* Contact
* Lead
* Opportunity
* Task

Running example
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Start Rhoconect Server (terminal #1)

```
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rhoconnect start 
```

* Start Fat Free CRM Server (terminal #2)

```
$ bundle install
$ rails server
```

TODO: Check Rhoconenct Web console

* Start Rhodes Client application (terminal #3)

```
$ rake run:rhosimulator
```

TODO:
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Rhodes client needs more work in GUI, esp. in create/update forms
* RhoConnect app should demonstrate usage of associations between models
